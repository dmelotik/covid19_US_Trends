Notes for the grader:

Right now the GUI layout is finished. There is no real functionality.
I will add css later once I finish adding the functionality. I expect
to move change the layout slightly in that time.
Apologies, but I created my project with a source folder. So my executable.jar
is located in src/.

Thanks :)

1) Add more input validation
	Check if the repo is in the correct folder
	Check array length of each line in the files
2) Add the output functionality
	Create a textbox for the user to choose where the output file goes
3) Add Tests for the data and calculations
4) Add application.css for styling
5) Optional: Add feature to update the repo through a button in the program
6) Optional: ??

Bugs:
1) Not every invalid input is accounted for, but as long as the repo is cloned and not changed it is fine
