Notes for the grader:

Right now the GUI layout is finished. There is no real functionality.
I will add css later once I finish adding the functionality. I expect
to move change the layout slightly in that time.
Apologies, but I created my project with a source folder. So my executable.jar
is located in src/.

Thanks :)
